# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hey there! I'm Asadbek, a dynamic iOS and web developer with a passion for crafting impeccable digital experiences. Whether I'm deep in the world of Swift and UIKit on the mobile side 📱💥 or weaving web wonders with ReactJS, React Native, and AWS on the desktop front, I ensure every line of code is infused with enthusiasm and precision.
<br>

When I'm not busy honing my Swift ninja skills or making UIKit groove to my rhythm, I'm diving into the vast universe of web development, embracing the power of ReactJS and cloud magic with AWS. 🌐⚡
<br>

Away from the screens, you'll catch me delving deep into GitHub, hunting for hidden treasures 💎, or lighting up the coding community with memes and laughter. 🚀🌌
<br>

In my realm, coffee ☕ pairs perfectly with code, and here's a fun thought: if debugging is all about exterminating bugs, then isn't coding about creating them? Worry not; I'm all in for flawless code, and that's a geek's oath! 😉
<br>

Take a leap into my repositories and voyage through my app-tastic and web-tacular escapades. Let's link up to exchange thoughts, collaborate, or just geek out over the freshest Apple revelations. 🍏

Unveiled at the HackaBull Hackathon, RecipeLab revolutionizes how users discover recipes. With a Tinder-inspired swipeable interface developed in React Native, users can effortlessly browse recipes suggested based on pictures of their ingredients. This seamless experience is driven by Google Vision, which identifies ingredients from images, coupled with the Spoonacular API, which curates recipe suggestions accordingly. While the app was originally built using React Native to cater to both Android and iOS users, a post-hackathon enhancement saw its transition to SwiftUI, showcasing flexibility and optimizing performance.

Launched for the HackJam Hackathon orchestrated by SHPE, hackjam.dev stands as a testament to strategic web design and development. Leading the website development, the team ensured tasks were evenly allocated and issues were promptly resolved. A standout feature is the eye-catching waving animation created with ReactJS and Tailwind, which not only amplified user experience but also drove a surge in interest — the website recorded over 200 hackathon sign-ups, surpassing initial expectations. Behind the scenes, the domain, hackjam.dev, was acquired from name.com, while hosting responsibilities were adeptly managed on Netlify.

For the EGN3000L Foundations of Engineering Lab, a captivating fusion of hardware and software took shape in the form of a Buzz Lightyear VR bot.

Under coordinated leadership, a group of five utilized 3D-printing technology to craft a detailed replica of Buzz Lightyear. Going beyond mere aesthetics, the bot was equipped with remote-control capabilities via Arduino components, showcasing hands-on engineering prowess.

The project's software dimension was equally groundbreaking. A VR application was developed using SwiftUI and ARCore, crafting captivating planetary environments. This virtual reality setting allowed the Buzz Lightyear bot to embark on exploratory journeys, underscoring an innovative blend of the physical and digital worlds.
